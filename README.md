Universal Clear Command

Introducing the universal clear command!

Say goodbye to having to define 'cls' and 'clear' separately for different operating systems. Embrace change with the newly released clear-command, which provides a UNIVERSAL clear command for all to use!

Installation

Install via pip! - https://pypi.org/project/clear-command/

pip install clear-command

Developed by Malik Hassan with much love!

Example Code:

\\\

import time
from clear_command import clearCommand

def main():
clear = clearCommand()
print(f"Command to clear console: {command}")

time.sleep(2.5)

import os
os.system(clear)

if **name** == "**main**":
main()

\\\

This script will print the command to clear your console, then wait 2.5 seconds and clear the console.
