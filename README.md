## Universal Clear Command

Introducing the universal clear command!

Say goodbye to having to define 'cls' and 'clear' separately for different operating systems. Embrace change with the newly released universalclear, which provides a UNIVERSAL clear command for all to use!

## Installation

Install via pip! - https://pypi.org/project/universalclear/

```bash
pip install universalclear
```

## Example Usage

```python
import time
from universalclear import clear

def main():
    print("Clearing console in 2.5 seconds!")

    time.sleep(2.5)

    clear()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will print the command to clear your console, then wait 2.5 seconds and clear the console.
